**A**: Don't give away personal info and write about your interests; it isn't required to be related to piracy. For example, if you're interested in philosophy, mention that and people with knowledge about it will react to your post.
You should mention where you belong to(not asking for address, only country/state/city), how you came to know about the forum, then what type content you are looking for, and if in case you have done something recognizable, or have been in some other reputed forums you can mention all that.

If you are using [bbcode](https://www.phpbb.com/), you have to use `[IMG]` tag. Example: `[IMG]https://hoster.com/image.png[/IMG]`.

For that, you need to use image hoster. We recommend [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/), [imgur](https://imgur.com) or [PostImages](https://postimages.org/) but you can use any other since it allows you to reach the original image link. Example: `https://hoster.com/image.png`.
