Then introduce yourself [over here](https://blackpearl.biz/intro/).

### Q: What to write for my introduction?
**A**: Don't give away personal info and write about your interests; it isn't required to be related to piracy. For example, if you're interested in philosophy, mention that and people with knowledge about it will react to your post.
You should mention where you belong to(not asking for address, only country/state/city), how you came to know about the forum, then what type content you are looking for, and if in case you have done something recognizable, or have been in some other reputed forums you can mention all that.
The system was supposed to filter out the trolls, but, honestly, if you write something good, people would be happy and friendly with you!

If you are using [bbcode](https://www.phpbb.com/), you have to use `[IMG]` tag. Example: `[IMG]https://hoster.com/image.png[/IMG]`.

For that, you need to use image hoster. We recommend [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/), [imgur](https://imgur.com) or [PostImages](https://postimages.org/) but you can use any other since it allows you to reach the original image link. Example: `https://hoster.com/image.png`.

In case you prefer to use Imgur, then instead of copying the default link that they provide, go over the image and press the three-dot button, from there select `Get Share Links` and copy the link that says `BBCode(Forums)`.
