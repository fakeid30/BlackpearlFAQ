### <a name="faq1">Q: What is Blackpearl?</a>
**A**: Blackpearl is much more than a forum. It's a complete platform to spend your time making friends and getting lost in whatever interests you. Aside from usual media, we have exclusive offerings like a Shop and VPN. We also give away various accounts on a regular interval.

### <a name="faq3">Q: What to write for my introduction?</a>
**A**: Don't give away personal info and write about your interests; it isn't required to be related to piracy. For example, if you're interested in philosophy, mention that and people with knowledge about it will react to your post.
You should mention where you belong to(not asking for address, only country/state/city), how you came to know about the forum, then what type content you are looking for, and if in case you have done something recognizable, or have been in some other reputed forums you can mention all that.
The system was supposed to filter out the trolls, but, honestly, if you write something good, people would be happy and friendly with you!

### <a name="faq4">Q: What are pearls and how do I earn them?</a>
**A**: Pearl is the currency we use to facilitate transaction in our forum.
You can earn pearls in 3 ways:
1) Fill user requests from various subsections.
2) Sell something in the pearls only section or provide a service. You can see the [Black Market Shop](https://blackpearl.biz/threads/8103/) for an inspiration.
3) Post items in the forum (Note: You can not share links from other forums). You must mirror it yourself and share it. The reward system is the following:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name of the section</th>
    <th>Minimum Pearls payout</th>
    <th>Maximum Pearls Payout</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4K Media</td>

Post quality is judged by the amount of effort you put into the creation of your thread. However, verbosity just for the sake of it is heavily discouraged and might require you to re-edit your post.

Conclusion: Being active, sharing stuff, and getting recognized is the first steps to get/stay user group promotion.

### <a name="faq6">Q: How do I get myself banned?</a>
**A**: This happens if you break any of the [forum rules](https://blackpearl.biz/rules/).

### <a name="faq7">Q: I just made a post, but it's not showing up anymore or it's not posted? Whats happening?</a>
**A**: It's most likely either in the Approval Queue or already deleted due to breaking the rules or for having an improper format/missing stuff.

Depending on why the post was deleted, the post creator may or may not get information about their post getting rejected. If you post something worthless, we won't even notify you in a PM. Usually if a reason is given you will recieve a notification.

If you are a Registered User or lower anything you post will be waiting for approval from a Moderator. Once approved, the post will become available on the forum.

### <a name="faq8">Q: How long does the approval process take and do all sections require approval?</a>
**A**: Usually posts are approved within 24 hours, but can take longer depending on Moderator is availability. PMing or asking Mods on Telegram will push your approval to the bottom of the list. Please do not bug the Moderators.
If you have the Boomer tag, then only posts in the [Golden Guides](https://blackpearl.biz/forums/154/) section need approval. However, if you don't have the Boomer tag, then all your posts require approval.

### <a name="faq9">Q: My post got deleted after pending approval. Can I post it again?</a>
**A**: Yes. Feel free to post again; however, it would be useful if you knew the reason why your post got deleted in the first place. This will allow you not to make the same mistake.

### <a name="faq10">Q: Which file hosters are accepted on the forum?</a>
**A**: The only downloadable sources allowed are Direct Download Links (DDL). A main file hoster is required, and any other file hoster can be added as a mirror. The main accepted file hosts are:
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) (Recommended)
* [MEGA](https://mega.nz/)
* [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/)
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/)
* [ZippyShare](https://zippyshare.com/)

### <a name="faq11">Q: How do I share download links?</a>
**A**: If you wish to share a link, then put it inside a `[DOWNCLOUD]` tag and have at least 1 Hide tag, `[/HIDEREACT]` should be on the farthest tag from the link: 

`[DOWNCLOUD] LINK [/DOWNCLOUD]` Shows the link in a button style. Do not use this for anything that's not a link (Base64)

`[HIDEREACTSCORE=X][/HIDEREACTSCORE]` : Hides everything inside until the User has a Reaction Score (Likes) of X.

`[HIDEPOSTS=X][/HIDEPOSTS]` : Hides everything inside until the User has a X amount of Posts.

`[DAYS=X][/DAYS]` : Hides everything inside until the User has been registered for X amount of days.

`[HIDEREACT=1,2,3,4,5,6][/HIDEREACT]` : Hides everything inside until the Reacts with one of your chosen Numbers.

1: Like 👍
2: Love 😍
3: Haha 🤣
4: Wow 😲
5: Sad 🙁
6: Angry 😡

`[HIDEREACT=1,2,3,4,5,6][HIDEREACTSCORE=1][HIDEPOSTS=1][DAYS=1][DOWNCLOUD] Link [/DOWNCLOUD][/DAYS][/HIDEPOSTS][/HIDEREACTSCORE][/HIDEREACT]`

If you wish to share a link inside the Blackpearl GSuite organization, then you MUST mention it in the post. Otherwise, you'll be warned. Posting Gdrive links under any other organization (i.e. edu) is allowed as long as it has External Access granted so everyone can access the files without asking for permission. Failure to do so can lead to a warning and deletion of your post.

In case you want extra protection, you can use the [Blackpearl's Link Protector](https://links.blackpearl.biz/).

### <a name="faq12">Q: How do I add tags in a post?</a>
**A**: While creating a thread, you can add comma-separated tags in the Tags text box under the post's content. If you already created the post and want to add/edit tags, then you can click on the <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Tags_font_awesome.svg/1024px-Tags_font_awesome.svg.png" alt="Tags Icon" width="25"/> under the thread's title and add/edit comma-separated tags.

### <a name="faq13">Q: How does one add a picture to a post? Also, what image hosters I can use?</a>
**A**: You can do this by clicking on the [little image icon](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/002/359/857/original/2019-09-19_181337.png?1568927759) at the post toolbar or using the hotkey `Ctrl+P`. If you are using [BBCode](https://blackpearl.biz/help/bb-codes/), you have to use the `[IMG]` tag. Example: `[IMG]https://hoster.com/image.png[/IMG]`.

For that, you need to use an image hoster. We recommend [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/), [imgur](https://imgur.com) or [PostImages](https://postimages.org/) but you can use any other, as long as it allows you to reach the original image link. Example: `https://hoster.com/image.png`.

For Imgur, instead of copying the default link that they provide, go over the image and press the three-dot button. From there, select `Get Share Links` and copy the link that says `BBCode(Forums)`. After that, you can paste the link to your post, but be aware that it won't show image in edit mode. If you want to resize the image, then press the preview button, and the image will be loaded in both the preview and edit mode.

### <a name="faq14">Q: How can I delete my post or move it to the correct section?.</a>
**A**: Only Pirates+ (and donators) can remove their posts. If you are not apart of the mentioned usergroups or need to move your post to the correct section, you will need to click on the report button, this can be found at the bottom of the post. Then you need to give the report reason and click on the report. Once the post is reported mod's will be notified. There is no reason for you to reach out to mods directly or ask in the Telegram chat for mods to look at your report. 

### <a name="faq15">Q: Why is there no option to edit my post?</a>
**A**: If you do not have the Pirate tag, you can not edit your own posts.

### <a name="faq16">Q: What can I post in the 'Pearls-Only' section?</a>
**A**: You can only post original or rare uploads. 
You can hide the content with this tag `[pearl=0]your content[/pearl]` the number denoting your desired pearl. 

### <a name="faq17">Q: How do I post and solve requests?</a>
Head over to the [request section](https://blackpearl.biz/#requests) and see if you can solve any requests. You can also post requests in the appropriate section and offer pearls.

### <a name="faq18">Q: Why is the like button not visible to me?</a>
**A**: If you are a new user, you need to post an [introduction](https://blackpearl.biz/intro/) to be able to get access to the rest of the forum. You can view posts but cannot react to them unless you post your introduction. If you have already done this, look to see if it also says "Insuffiencent Privileges To Reply Here" and follow the advice below.

### <a name="faq19">Q: What is the meaning of "YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT PRIVILEGES TO REPLY HERE."?</a>
**A**: This happens because you are in the "Registered" or "Boomers" user group and can not give likes or post replies in other members threads in certain sections;
If you would like access to these sections, you have to contribute on the forum to get the Pirate tag. The Pirate tag can be purchased from the [shop](https://blackpearl.biz/shop/) for 75 pearls.

### <a name="faq20">Q: I purchased a BlackPearl Gsuite from the shop. Can someone help me figure out how to use it?</a>
**A**: You will soon receive credentials (mail and a temporary password) for the GSuite account in your PM from an Admin. GSuite is like any other edu/Gmail account; with unlimited storage and capability of making team drives! All you have to do is to log in to the Google account with the email and temporary password you were given and change your password.

### <a name="faq21">Q: Can we buy reaction score with pearls? If no, why not?</a>
**A**: No, you can not purchase reaction score with pearls as it would result with spamming in the forum.

### <a name="faq22">Q: Can we purchase more than 1 Gsuite account?</a>
**A**: According to new rules, you can only purchase 1 Gsuite account.

### <a name="faq23">Q: How do I check how many pearls I have? Who is the wealthiest user?</a>
**A**: [Clicking here](https://blackpearl.biz/pearls/) you can check how many pearls you have, who the wealthiest user is, and all the pearls you have won or spent.

### <a name="faq24">Q: Can I donate pearls to other members (my friends), so that they can purchase something from the shop.</a>
**A**: Members have misused this feature. So from now on, if any member is found to be abusing the system, both the member and the other person will be banned. You can donate if you liked their work or post. However, you should not misuse this feature. In case you want to do so, you can ask for permission from the ADMINS stating your reasons, and if they allow it, then you may proceed with the donation.

### <a name="faq25">Q: How do I sell items in the shop?</a>
**A**: You need to contact the admins and let them know what you want to sell. We will help you make a post and set the price.

### <a name="faq26">Q: How can I change my user name?</a>
**A**: If you have a Donator tag, then you can change your user name every 24 hours. However, if you do not have a Donator tag, then you can change your user name only once every 30 days.

### <a name="faq27">Q: Can I have a custom color for my user ID?</a>
**A**: Different colors represent different groups, so you can not have a custom color.

### <a name="faq28">Q: Are alternate accounts allowed?</a>
**A**: No, alternate accounts are NOT allowed. If any were to be found, both accounts would be banned.

### <a name="faq29">Q: Why does the [How to get free Account on Various Service](https://blackpearl.biz/forums/116/) section have a password?</a>
**A**: This is a forum with tutorials to create profiles on various services. This section is locked behind a password to avoid leechers & copyright trolls.
To get the password, you need to have 500 likes on your profile. Once you have that, please go to this [thread](https://blackpearl.biz/threads/907/) to receive the password.

### <a name="faq30">Q: Who should I contact for which issues?</a>
**A**: For any Account related issues, Contact ADMINS (members whose user ID is in RED)
       For Post related issues, Contact that section's Moderators.

### <a name="faq31">Q: I want to suggest some improvements. Where should I go to do that?</a>
**A**: Go to our [Suggestions & feedback](https://blackpearl.biz/forums/47/) section and start a new thread and write your suggestions.

### <a name="faq32">Q: How do I get in the Encoders usergroup?</a>
**A**: If you are an Encoder you can prove your identity and avail the Encoder usergroup. The process is following:
  1) Your public encoding name must match your BP username. You can have different username here after verification is done.
  2) Send a message here: https://1337x.to/user/ChoromPotro/ from your encoder profile. The subject line should be: "Encoder verification for BP"
  3) PM [ChoromPotro](https://blackpearl.biz/conversations/add?to=ChoromPotro) in BP saying that you have already done step 2.

That's it, the status will change after the verification. The whole process should take less than an hour.

### <a name="faq33">Q: How do I gain Invitation Codes?</a>
A: In order to create Invitation codes, you must be apart of the Boomers Usergroup or above. First click your username in the top right corner, then click "Your invitations". From there you will be able to create Invitation codes and view existing codes that were already created by you. Be aware of users you have invited as their actions are reflected upon you. If they cause trouble it can lead to both the referrer and referral being banned.
